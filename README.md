## Why `ValorantVirtoggle`?

For those who enjoy playing Valorant, you might have encountered an issue with its anti-cheat system, Vanguard. Vanguard requires players to disable hardware virtualization on their computers. This can be a hassle, especially for users who frequently switch between gaming and tasks that require virtualization, such as running virtual machines for work or development purposes.

Having to manually toggle hardware virtualization every time you switch activities can be tedious and time-consuming. `ValorantVirtoggle` was created to address this specific challenge. With a simple run of this script, you can easily toggle hardware virtualization on or off, allowing you to transition between work and play without headaches.

## Features
- Checks and displays the current state of virtualization.
- Provides a user-friendly menu to toggle virtualization.
- Requests administrative privileges to make changes.
- Offers an option to restart the system after changes, as a restart is often required to apply virtualization settings.

## Usage
1. Download the `ValorantVirtoggle.bat` script.
2. Run and you will be prompted to open as admin.
3. The script will display the current state of virtualization.
4. Choose the desired option from the menu to enable or disable virtualization.
5. Decide whether to restart immediately or later based on the prompt.

## Note
Always ensure you save any ongoing work before restarting your system.
